## Encryption in Julius Caeser
This right here is my recent prototype of an encryption app.

It's simple to run, just write a plain text and write a key, this encryption method will add your pre-existing text to the key, making an encrypted cipher (not the best method).

If you want to decrypt, write a negative key and a cipher text inside the compiler.
